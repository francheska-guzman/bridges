<!-- About bridges -->
	<h2>What is a bridge?</h2>
	<p>A bridge is a structure built to span physical obstacles without closing the way underneath such as a body of water, valley, or road, for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle.</p>

	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>The first bridges made by humans were probably spans of cut wooden logs or planks and eventually stones, using a simple support and crossbeam arrangement. Some early Americans used trees or bamboo poles to cross small caverns or wells to get from one place to another. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge">Click Here</a> to learn more about bridges!</p>
